 # microservices :- 
 key points
 -easy to adopt future tackstack becouse all servises arejust connected by api endpoint only
 -one servise not eccect other servises.
 -we can scale it more in according to use 


# way to make robust and flexible architacher by:- 
  (1)Loose Coupling ,(2)High cohesion

Loose Coupling :- changing in one service shout NOT require chnage in other servise.
                Ex:-payment and order ,if you change in payment servise it shoud not effect order servise and both should me as diff servise.
High Cohesion :- related functionality shoud be part of the same microservices.
                 Related behaviors sit togather & unrelated behaviours sit separately.
                 Asy this questions "i am putting this tow modules in same microservise are thery related " 
                 if they are same go and put in same module,if they are not create sepreat one so you can reuse it again.
